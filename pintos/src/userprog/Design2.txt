We couldn't resolve a page fault happening when a user-context instruction
tried to write to a nonexistent user-space page located almost directly less
than PHYSBASE-PGSIZE. This halted our progress. However, we left in a hex_dump()
call so you can verify that the argument passing is correctly filling the user stack.

In start_process(), we tokenized the raw input in a new page. As we
iterated through the tokenizer, we stored the addresses of each argument
in another page as well as the number of arguments. We passed these into
setup_stack(), where we decrement esp as we store arguments in reverse
order on the stack. Then, esp is rounded down to the nearest word boundary
before we store the argument addresses themselves on the stack (first
setting argv[argc] equal to 0). Finally, we store argc (number of
arguments) and a fake return address (0).

The stack page will not be overflown because the arguments and argument
pointers are each restricted to (PGSIZE/2)-8 bytes while copying/tokenizing,
leaving at least 16 bytes free. The padding bytes, argv[argc], argc, and
return address will take a maximum of 15 bytes, so the stack's page cannot
be filled completely.

Less complexity in the kernel.
More secure against kernel errors/panics.
Fewer headaches for the poor engineering students.

			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.



>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

File descriptors are unique only within a single process, the process that
currently has the files open. We put the fd value in the struct file and
put a list of open files in each struct thread for easy access.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

Any pointers from the user are verified by new function user_pointer_is_valid()
before use. user_pointer_is_valid() checks that pointers are non-null, user
addresses, and refer to an existing page in the active page table directory
using calls to vaddr.h and pagedir.h functions.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

exec() first checks for a valid pointer before proceeding. Then
process_execute() takes over. Any errors in process_execute() immediately
cause -1 to be returned to exec(), which returns the result to
syscall_handler(). syscall_handler() returns the result to the user
program by storing it at eax.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?



---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

The project document suggested that checking pointer validity was easier
than handling the page faults, so we chose the easier option.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

It is fairly simple and easy to use. However, it may require some performance
overhead when looking through the list of files.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We did not change it.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

Debugging page faults took a very large amount of time. GDB was far less
useful because we couldn't get it to work with user programs, even using loadusersymbols.
